This project is an attempt to create an easy-to-use music tag editor under Mac. While there are excellent tag tools under window, such as [mp3tag](http://www.mp3tag.de/en/), there is no one under Mac that can satisfy my needs. Thus I decided to make one for myself.

iD3Editor provides features listed below:
* batch processing music files;
* formating tags to lowercase, uppercase and capitalizations;
* fixing the character encoding of tags (more than 30 language encodings);
* conversion between tags and file names;

iD3Editor supports popular music file types such as mp3, mp4, ape, flac, ogg, oga, spx, wav and more. Please check www.id3Editor.com for detailed introductions.

To compile iD3Editor, you need to download the latest version of [taglib](http://taglib.github.io), and build it as a static library.

You can also purchase a compiled version of iD3Editor from [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id3-editor/id910408628?ls=1&mt=12)
